## Service administration

Being a hoster requires a webinterface that eases your daily work. Also clans and sponsoring projects do not want to give up the comfort a webinterface can bring them.

## Quick start


### Stable Installer up to Debian 8, 9 and 10, Ubuntu 16.10, 18.04, 18.10 and 20.04 and CentOS 7 and 8
```sh
wget -O installer.tar.gz https://github.com/easy-wi/installer/archive/3.2.tar.gz

* Independent or in combination with the webspace MySQL or MariaDB can be managed.
* A CMS to manage your pages and news.
